# Welcome to myPMtool’s documentation!

This is documenatation for python based library myPMlib. It was created as very customized set of simple tools to manage projects by

- planning work for the team,
- managing the tasks,
- create customized Gantt charts
- helping to create WBS

It was never mind to become full fladged piece of software and for the moment it’s main purpose is to allow do my work (as Program Manager) and practice python coding at the same time. Suprisigly enough it prove to be quite a handy tool.

At the moment there is no gui implemented and the intended way of usng this set of tools is via iPhyton console (spyder do the job very well). If you find it in any matter interesting please use it as you want.

Thanks!
